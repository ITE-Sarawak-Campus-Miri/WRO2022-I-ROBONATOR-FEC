## Introduction

This project is a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2022. The vehicle is designed to be able to drive on a 2D surface and to be able to detect and avoid obstacles. The vehicle is contructed with Lego Mindstorms EV3 Education set and is controlled by Lego Mindstorms EV3 Brick.

## Build of Robot

The build of vehicle is mainly based on Lego Mindstorms EV3 Education set. The vehicle is constructed with 2 motors, 1 color sensor, 1 gyro sensor, 1 ultrasonic sensor and [Pixy2](https://pixycam.com/pixy2/) Camera. The vehicle is controlled by Lego Mindstorms EV3 Brick.

### Chassis

The chassis is constructed with Lego Technic Parts from Lego Mindstorms EV3 Education set.

### Motors

There are 2 motors in the vehicle. One motor is used to drive the vehicle and the other one is used to control the steering of the vehicle.

#### Motor 1: Steering Motor

Lego Medium Servo Motor is used as the steering motor.

#### Motor 2: Driving Motor

Lego Large Servo Motor is used as the driving motor. The driving motor is connected to a differential gear which allows one wheel to travel at a different speed than the other during turning, while both remain powered.

### Sensors

### Software

The software is written with Lego Mindstorms EV3-Graphics programming language.

The software is divided into 2 parts: `CONFIG` and `MAIN`.

#### CONFIG

The `CONFIG` part is the configuration part of the software. It contains the configuration of the vehicle.

#### MAIN

The `MAIN` part is the main part of the software. It contains the main program of the vehicle.
